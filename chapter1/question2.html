        <h1>Question 2</h1>
        <p>Copy the code that you wrote for question 1 to a new file and link to it on this page right before the closing body tag. Be sure to add it AFTER the jQuery script tag. Using that code as a starting point, extend the functionality of your program by making the following enhancements:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Instead of using JavaScript alerts, display the results of the roll in html on the page
                <ol>
                    <li>Create an empty div on the page and give it an id of <strong>roll_result</strong>. We are going to be using the bootstrap CSS library for all of these examples. Notice the link tag in the head for it. With that in mind, give it a class of <strong>alert</strong>. This div should not display until <em>after</em> we roll so give it a class of <strong>hidden</strong> as well</li>
                    <li>Take the messages from the previous example and insert them into your newly created roll_result div.</li>
                    <li>Show the div (it was hidden remember?)</li>
                    <li>If the result is too high or too low, add a class of alert-danger. If the numbers match, add a class of alert-success.</li>
                    <li>Hide roll_result after 5 seconds. Remove the classes alert-danger and alert-success from it.</li>
                </ol>
            </li>  
            
        </ol>
