<h3>Updating the DOM with JQuery/JavaScript objects, arrays and functions</h3>

<!-- 
	BE SURE TO TEST EACH QUESTION TO MAKE SURE THAT IT _WORKS_ BEFORE YOU COMMIT/PUSH. 
	THIS IS IMPORTANT TO MAKE PART OF YOUR PROCESS AS YOU WILL BE EXPECTED TO DO 
	THE SAME IN ANY OFFICE ENVIRONMENT. THE BOTTOM LINE IS THIS: _NEVER_ CHECK IN
	CODE UNLESS YOU ARE CONFIDENT THAT IT WORKS AND HAVE TESTED IT YOURSELF.

	YOUR ANSWERS SHOULD GO INTO A SEPARATE SCRIPT FILE. NOTE CLEARLY WITH A CODE COMMENT WHICH QUESTION THEY ANSWER

	IF SOMETHING IS NOT WORKING, USE YOUR TOOLS TO DEBUG IT. 
	THE FIRST STEP IS TO CHECK FIREBUG FOR ANY ERRORS. THESE WILL BE DISPLAYED IN THE CONSOLE TAB.

	<p>1) As we've discussed, its possible to GET and SET content inside of a given piece of HTML. Using example_1_1, console log the inner text (no markup) of that element</p>


	<p>2) console log the inner html of example_1_1</p>

	<div id="example_1_1"><span class="inner_text">some text!</span></div>
	
	<p>3) replace the inner text of example_1_2 with the words 'replaced!'</p>

	<p>4) replace the inner html of example_1_2 with an anchor tag that points to http://google.com with the words 'click me to go to Google' inside of it</p>
		
	<div id="example_1_2"><span class="inner_text">To be replaced!</span></div>	
	
	<p>5) Insert an image tag pointing to http://9pixs.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/chiwawa-puppies_1404253665.jpg inside example_1_3 right at the beginning. The content that it already has should NOT be replaced.</p>

	<div id="example_1_3"><span class="inner_text">There should be an image before me!!</span></div>		

	<p>6) Remove all html inside of example_1_4. BONUS: there are two methods that can perform this task. What are they?</p>

	<div id="example_1_4"><span class="inner_text">To be removed!</span></div>	

	<p>7) How can I be sure that my JQuery doesnt fire until my document has fully loaded (aka my docment is 'ready')?</p>

	<p>8) Give an example of an object. Give it 3 properties, 1 array, and one method. You may name it and its key/values whatever you want</p>

	<p>9) Whats an anonymous function? Where would this be useful?</p>

	<p>10) Loop through each li tag in example_1_5 and console.log its inner text</p>

	<ul id="example_1_5">
		<li>first</li>
		<li>second</li>
		<li>third</li>
		<li>fourth</li>
		<li>fifth</li>
	</ul>
